1. Welcome
==========

This spellchecker is Free Software:

  Free to use - Free to share - Free to change.

See section 4. Contributing to see how you can help make it even better.


Why Free Software?
------------------

The Translate.org.za project's aim is to make language resources and software 
available to the speakers of that language and licensed in such a way that the 
resources remain Free and thus available to all the language's speakers. After 
all it is you, the speakers of Zulu, who have actually developed and made Zulu 
into the language that it is today.

What is Free Software?

2. Copyright
============

Zulu wordlist
-------------

The Zulu wordlist used by the spell checker is made up of multiple wordlists.
These are either in the public domain, are used with the author's permission 
or are licensed under the GPL.  Many of the classified words are derived from 
data developed in collaboration with researchers from UNISA.

Zulu affix File
------------------

Copyright (C) 2009 Friedel Wolff under the GPL

The affix file is generated by a Python script. Both the script and the affix 
file is licensed under the GPL


3. Installation and Setup
=========================

Automated
---------

Newer versions of OpenOffice.org have a built in macro to step you through an 
automatic install process.

  File -> Autopilot -> Install new dictionaries...

If this is unavailable then download 'DicOOo.sxw' from:
http://ftp.services.openoffice.org/pub/OpenOffice.org/contrib/dictionaries/dicooo/DicOOo.sxw

Run the macro and follow the steps outlined.  If you would like the dictionary
to be available to all users then run the installation as the administrative or
root user.  It is best to restart OpenOffice.org after the installation.

The macro operates in two modes:

1) Online - the latest dictionaries are retrieved from the OpenOffice.org
   website.

2) Offline - an offline dictionary pack, which you have already downloaded, is
   installed from the hard-drive.  Offline dictionaries can be downloaded from:
   http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/dictpack.html 
    OR
   http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=91920&package_id=103504

For more detailed instructions see:
  http://lingucomponent.openoffice.org/auto_instal.html


Non-automated

Spellchecker Selection
----------------------

Once the spellchecker is installed you need to configure a few settings and
perform some checks.

1) Check that the Zulu spellchecker is enabled.

  Tools -> Options -> Language Settings -> Writing Aids

In the section marked 'Available language modules' select 'Edit...'.  Under
the languages drop-down select Zulu and ensure that the 'OpenOffice.org
MySpell SpellChecker' is enabled.

2) Set your default document language to Zulu

If most of your writing is in Zulu then this step will ensure that
documents you compose from now on are treated as Zulu documents.  If much
of your writing is in English you might want to skip this step.

  Tools -> Options -> Language Settings -> Languages

In the section marked 'Default languages for documents' is a drop-down labelled
'Western'.  Zulu has a tick next to it to indicate that a spellchecker is 
installed.  Set your default language to Zulu.

3) Changing existing documents or paragraphs to Zulu

Some old document might be written in Zulu but the document was stored
indicating that the text was in English.  You can indicate that this is
Zulu text by:

    a) Select the relevant text (Ctrl-A selects the whole document)
    b) Format -> Character...
       Change the 'Language' drop-down to Zulu.
